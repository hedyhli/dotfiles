# dotfiles

I mostly use these for Ubuntu/Debian and sometimes with WSL, but it should work for other
Linux distros, feel free to pick and choose. Because the only OS specific thing (I think)
is [this fish function](.config/fish/functions/apt-up.fish) which updates packages with apt.


### Basics
- Manager: yadm
- Shell: fish
- Theme: Dracula
- Email: aerc
- Browser:
   - Chrome :P
   - w3m
- Gemini/Gopher browser: bombadillo
- Editor:

### Notes for setup

**Python**
- git fame
- termdown
- pyjokes

**Shell/Misc**

### Todo
