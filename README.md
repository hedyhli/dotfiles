# dotfiles

I mostly use these for Ubuntu/Debian and sometimes with WSL, but it should work for other
Linux distros. The only OS specific thing (I think)
is [this fish function](.config/fish/functions/apt-up.fish) which updates packages with apt.


### Basics
- Manager: yadm
- Shell: fish
- Theme: Dracula
- Email: aerc
- Browser:
   - Chrome (has nothing to do with this repo though)
   - w3m
- Gemini client: amfora
- Editor:
   - (Neo)Vim with CoC

### Requirements for setup

(these should be in [these setup scripts](_script/) unless I forgot to include them there)

- git-diff: diff-so-fancy
- vim plugins: [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
- nvim plugins: [plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plughttps://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- fish stuff: [omf](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)

### Todo
- [x] Add links for above
- [x] Put fish aliases into separate place
- [x] Write setup scripts
- [ ] Add a mapping for gg=G\`\`
